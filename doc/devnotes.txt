Write an idea for a distributed diff algorithm that compares files by binary search.
Each local endpoint creates a hash of the version of the target file.
Exchange the hash with the controlling endpoint.
If different, each endpoint divides the file data by two, creates hashes of the parts and exchange again.
For the parts that are different, repeat step 4 until a minimum list of different parts is obtained.
